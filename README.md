# 🚔 LAPD Crime Data Analysis (2020 - Present)

This project analyzes crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) from 2020 to the present. It aims to extract insights, visualize patterns, and understand crime distribution across time, location, and type.

## 📁 Dataset

Sourced from the [LAPD Open Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/), this dataset includes:
- Report and occurrence dates
- Area and location data
- Victim demographics
- Crime codes and descriptions
- Weapon details
- Case status

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Renamed columns
  - Converted date/time fields
  - Handled missing values
  - Removed irrelevant columns

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Monthly and yearly crime trends
  - Crimes by hour of the day
  - Crime-prone areas
  - Top crime types
  - Weapon usage analysis
  - Victim demographics
  - Case status overview
  - Interactive crime map using Plotly

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📍 Insights

- Crime shows seasonal and time-based trends
- Certain areas report more crimes consistently
- Most crimes occur in the evening and night
- Vehicle theft and burglary are most common

## 🔮 Future Work

- Apply clustering (KMeans, PCA) for pattern discovery
- Predict future crimes using ML models
- Correlate with socioeconomic/demographic data
